# GameofAmazons

A simple project for the Game of Amazons I made for a class during my first year in University.

It is a Game of Amazons with options to play with the bot, or play with another player/yourself.
Included are some basic functions and logic, but the bot in the code simply chooses moves randomly and has no AI
